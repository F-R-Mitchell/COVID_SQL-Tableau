### Brief Explanation 
The project above shows the COVID-19 infection and death rate organized by country and world region. The line chart on the bottom half of the dashboard displays the average infection percentage between December 2019 and September 2021. The line chart also shows the projected trajectory of the average infection percentage for six randomly selected countries.  

The data was cleaned and organized using SQL into separate excel files then imported into Tableau.
